            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
              A term loan is a fixed loan offered by banks and financial
              institutions for a specific amount, with a structured repayment
              plan at either a fixed or floating interest rate. It is ideal for
              established small and medium businesses with strong financial
              records. In some cases, a down payment may be required to help
              reduce repayment amounts and overall borrowing costs.

              Term loans for MSMEs are designed to support startup owners, small

              basis. Loan tenure varies from lender to lender. Since many MSME
              loans are unsecured, applicants must meet certain eligibility
              criteria to help minimize risk for lenders.

              Applying for a term loan requires careful preparation. Many

              rejection. Common reasons include incorrect documentation, poor
              credit history, guarantor issues, or insufficient income proof. A
              professional consultant ensures accurate paperwork and improves
              approval chances.

              To apply for a term loan, a detailed loan file must be prepared

              Applicants must also be ready for inspections or verification
              visits. Only after thorough evaluation will the loan be approved.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Ultimately, lenders assess whether the business can generate
              adequate income to repay the loan responsibly.
